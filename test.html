    <p>The Virginia Military Institute, or VMI, is a college in Lexington, Virginia. It was founded in 1839 and is the oldest senior 
        military college in the nation. It is known for its unique system which incorporates a college education along with military
        training and ROTC programs. The biggest challenge when coming to VMI, however, is are the rigors of the ratline.
        <br>
        <br>
        The ratline is a 6 month process for incoming freshman, or rats, to learn how to become a part of the Corps of Cadets at VMI. 
        Rats are challenged mentally and physically non stop for the entire 6 months. During this time is where you see many people 
        either embrace the system, or fall short and break. This is more than likely the hardest challenge one faces during their young
        adult life.

        <br>
        When the rats first show up to VMI on their Matriculation Day, they start off a week before classes in order to have a "crash course" 
        persay of how to be a rat. This week is known as Hell Week. You can click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQFQxwPhtHE">
